# ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Working Group (`HAWG`)

The ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Working Group (or `HAWG` for short) is an open and community-driven robotics group that drives the creation, maintenance and testing of hardware acceleration kernels on top of open standards for optimized ROS 2 and Gazebo interactions over different compute substrates, including FPGAs and GPUs.
